Description: Data sets and functions for geotechnical reliability analysis. The GeoRiskR develops for geotechnical engineers to perform reliability analysis, in which several existing data sets (soil shear strengths, rock shear strengths, GCL shear strengths, soil texture, and the relation between initial void ratio and compression index) are compiled. The collected datasets are adopted from the existing literature, for instance,the data of shear strength parameters of soils composed by 509 paired parameters (including cohesion and inner friction angle) observed at 22 locations from 12 published papers.
