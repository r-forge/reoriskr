\title{
	Shear strengths of soils
}
\description{
	Data sets covers the shear strengths from soils
}
\usage{
	SoilShear(cohesion, friction angle)
}
\arguments{
  \item{cohesion}{
	a numeric for the cohesion, in kPa
}
  \item{friction angle}{
	a numeric for the inner friction angle, in degree
}
}
\details{
	The data set contains several columns : cohesion, friction angle, unit grivity, investigator, published year, soil name.
}
\value{
	Returns a matrix that contains above values for each soils included in the data set.
